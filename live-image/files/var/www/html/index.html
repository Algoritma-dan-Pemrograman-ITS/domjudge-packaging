<p>This host is running a DOMjudge-live image that contains a
ready-to-use copy of the <a href="https://www.domjudge.org">
DOMjudge programming contest jury system</a>. It runs on the
<a href="https://www.debian.org">Debian GNU/Linux</a> operating system
and the <a href="https://www.apache.org/">Apache</a> webserver.</p>

<h2>Web interfaces</h2>

<p>The following web interfaces are available:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/domjudge/public/"><strong>Public interface:</strong></a> shows the scoreboard.</li>
<li><a href="/domjudge/team/"><strong>Team interface:</strong></a> allows a team to submit and
    view submissions and clarifications, and view and the scoreboard.</li>
<li><a href="/domjudge/jury/"><strong>Jury/admin interface:</strong></a> the full set of options
    available to judges/admins. A user <em>admin</em> is available that also has a team
    <em>DOMjudge</em> associated to it.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note</strong> that initially the system root passwords is
<em>domjudge</em> and domjudge admin user password is <em>admin</em>.
These should be changed as soon as possible. Use the script
<code>dj_live</code> on the system to change passwords.</p>

<p>Additionally <a href="/phpmyadmin"><strong>phpMyAdmin</strong></a>
is available. Login with the MySQL <em>domjudge_sql</em> user to
access and modify the DOMjudge database. The password can be found
in <code>/etc/domjudge/domserver.dbconfig.php</code>.</p>

<h2>Problem statements</h2>

<p>The system is preconfigured with a demo contest that contains three
problems. The problem statement texts for these problems can be
downloaded here (in PDF format):</p>
