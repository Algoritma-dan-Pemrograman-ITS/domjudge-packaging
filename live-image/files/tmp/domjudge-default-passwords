   *** This DOMjudge live image is configured with predefined ***
   *** passwords. It is strongly recommended to change these! ***
   **************************************************************

The default password for root on the system is 'domjudge'.
It is strongly recommended to change this, especially if using this
DOMjudge live instance for more than simple testing. Note that openSSH
server runs by default, and allows root logins with password. It is
recommended to install your SSH public key and in /etc/ssh/sshd_config
set 'PermitRootLogin prohibit-password'.

The program 'dj_live' can be used to change passwords and perform some
other tasks. Run it as root without arguments for usage information.

Furthermore, if you are running other, judgehost instances, you will
want to copy /etc/domjudge/restapi.secret to these machines and edit
the URL to point to the main DOMjudge server.

See the file '/README' for more details.
