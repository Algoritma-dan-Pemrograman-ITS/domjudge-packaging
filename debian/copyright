A binary version of the dash shell (statically compiled)
is distributed with the DOMjudge source (but not installed into
any of the binary packages).
The dash shell was taken from the Debian package dash-udeb version
0.5.3-7, see http://packages.debian.org/etch/dash-udeb. The sources
can be (re-)obtained from: http://domjudge.sourceforce.net/sources/
