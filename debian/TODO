General
-------
- We build-depend on apache2-utils (htpasswd) and sharutils (uuencode),
  both are used for password generation which passwords we subsequently
  throw away. Better solution is probably to not b-d on them but to
  disable the password generation e.g. via a patch.

Domserver
---------
- Move not-directly-called stuff out of PATH or /etc.
- Do some apache configuration.

Judgehost
---------
- Do we need to deal with Java chroot differently?
- Judgedaemon daemonizing does not yet work (with PHP 5.2.10).
- Why is runguard in /usr/sbin? It's never called directly.
