This repository contains packaging code for DOMjudge in various
subdirectories. Below some information on these.


DOMjudge Debian packaging HOWTO
-------------------------------

The Debian packaging is located under /debian.

Make sure you have installed the meta-package 'packaging-dev' and the
DOMjudge build dependencies as specified in the admin manual.

Take a domjudge-x.y.z.tar.gz tarball and rename/symlink it to
domjudge_x.y.z.orig.tar.gz.

Extract it. Copy in the debian/ directory into this directory and
chdir to domjudge-x.y.z/.

Run from that position
  dch -v 3.3.4 -m "New upstream release."

Run
  debuild

If everything was in order you will now get a .dsc (source package)
and several .deb's (binary package). If not, find out why and fix it.


DOMjudge live USB image
-----------------------

Under /live-usb some packaging scripts are available to build an USB
image to run DOMjudge from without installing it. This image is based
on Debian and the DOMjudge Debian packages.

See /live-usb/README for more details. Note that a lot of the
process of generating a complete USB image is automated, but not
completely.
