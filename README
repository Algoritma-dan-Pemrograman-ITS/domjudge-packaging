DOMjudge Debian packaging HOWTO
-------------------------------

Make sure you have installed the meta-package 'packaging-dev' and the
DOMjudge build dependencies as specified in the admin manual.

Take a domjudge-x.y.z.tar.gz tarball and rename/symlink it to
domjudge_x.y.z.orig.tar.gz.

Extract it. Copy in the debian/ directory into this directory and
chdir to domjudge-x.y.z/.

Run from that position
  dch -v 3.3.4 -m "New upstream release."

Run
  debuild

If everything was in order you will now get a .dsc (source package)
and several .deb's (binary package). If not, find out why and fix it.
