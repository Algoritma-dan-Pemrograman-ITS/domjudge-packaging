Debian Squeeze DOMjudge live-USB system
=======================================

NOTE: these images are not Debian-live systems in the sense of
http://live.debian.net/ but just plain Debian installations that can
be copied onto an USB stick and booted from there. That is, any
changes made are persistently stored on the image.

build Debian Squeeze image, boot a netinst CD (e.g. in KVM) with
kernel boot options:

auto url=<webhost>/<path>/preseed.cfg

where the preseed.cfg file is made available at that url.


optionally copy SSH keys for easier access:

$ ssh-copy-id root@<dhcp_hostname>

then install domjudge-live specific stuff: first copy generated
DOMjudge debian packages into the files/tmp folder, then run

$ make && ./install.sh root@<dhcp_hostname>


==================

TODO:

cleanup ssh keys, /var/lib/domjudge, mysql DB

debian-live stuff? hostname...

update dj-live script
