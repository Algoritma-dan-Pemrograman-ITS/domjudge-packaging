Debian Squeeze DOMjudge live-USB system
=======================================

NOTE: these images are not Debian-live systems in the sense of
http://live.debian.net/ but just plain Debian installations that can
be copied onto an USB stick and booted from there. That is, any
changes made are persistently stored on the image.

build Debian Squeeze image, boot netinst CD (e.g. in KVM) with boot
options:

auto url=<webhost>/<path>/preseed.cfg

where the preseed.cfg file is made available at that url.


optionally copy SSH keys for easier access:

$ ssh-copy-id root@<dhcp_hostname>

then install domjudge-live specific stuff:

$ make && ./install.sh root@<dhcp_hostname>


==================

/etc/init.d/domjudge-judgehost	use daemonize option, fixed in SVN

packages added:

domjudge-{doc,common,domserver,judgehost} + dependencies + recommends

domjudge config:

$ dj_make_chroot

- enable languages
- add judgehost

TODO:

cleanup ssh keys, /var/lib/domjudge, mysql DB

starting judgedaemon from postinst hangs

debian-live stuff? hostname...
