**********************************************************************

The default password for the system and MySQL root accounts is 'domjudge'.
It is strongly recommended to change these, especially if using this
DOMjudge live USB instance for more than simple testing. Note that
openSSH server runs by default, and allows root logins with password!

The program 'dj-live' can be used to change these passwords and
perform some other tasks. Run it as root without arguments for usage
information.

See the file '/README' for more details on this image and how to use it.
